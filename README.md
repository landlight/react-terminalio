# React Terminalio (v1.0)

Welcome to the React Terminalio Portfolio! This project is inspired by the idea of having a terminal-style portfolio. The goal is to create a unique and cool way to showcase your skills and projects. I also would like to test out the power of chatgpt, so i used chatgpt-3, however, it could only help out of basic implementation but was not very usefull in styling, ascii code generation and customizing the components.
